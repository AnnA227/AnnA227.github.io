## Teaching

In 2023/24 I am tutoring on the following courses:

* LEL2D: Cross-Linguistic Variation: Limits and Theories (LASC08020)
* PPLS Skills Centre: one-on-one academic writing appointments

I have previously tutored on the following:
* LEL1B: Linguistics and English Language 1B (LASC08023)

I have also tutored on these courses (School of Mathematics, Trinity College Dublin):
* MA1111/MA1212: Linear Algebra
* MA1124/MA1125: Real Analysis
* MA1241/MA1242: Mechanics
* MA3432: Classical Electrodynamics
* MA342H: Partial Differential Equations
* MA1S12: Mathematics for Scientists

## My teaching philosophy

As an educator in a university context, I see my role as being less about imparting knowledge and more about guiding and supporting the students as they develop their ability to think critically and independently. As such, my teaching approach focuses on getting the students to actively engage with the material and to learn through exploration. I encourage my students to ask probing questions, to look for weak spots in any theory that has been put forward, and more generally to start seeing themselves in the role of independent researcher.

Throughout my time as a tutor, I have actively sought out opportunities to develop my teaching practice and to learn from my experiences in the classroom. As a result, I have built up a toolkit of practical techniques for classroom management, and I have also developed a clearer view of my own goals as a teacher. I hope to continue building on this foundation, always seeking new ways to support students in their academic journey.

This semester, I am enrolled in the [Introduction to Academic Practice (IntroAP)](https://institute-academic-development.ed.ac.uk/learning-teaching/cpd/intro-ap){:target="_blank"} teaching development course run by Edinburgh's Institute for Academic Development. Participating in this course has given me the opportunity to reflect deeply on my teaching practice, and will hopefully lead to official recognition of my teaching through [Associate Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (HEA)](https://advance-he.ac.uk/fellowship/associate-fellowship){:target="_blank"}.
