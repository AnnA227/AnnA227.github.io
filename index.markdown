#### FÃ¡ilte!

I'm Anna Laoide-Kemp, a PhD student in the University of Edinburgh, working in the field of Theoretical Linguistics. My research interests include **phonological and morphosyntactic theory**, with a particular focus on the **interface between these modules**. My PhD project is on the analysis of Irish initial consonant mutations (ICM) within a modular grammatical architecture.
