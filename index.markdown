#### FÃ¡ilte!

I'm Anna Laoide-Kemp, a PhD research student working in the field of Theoretical Linguistics. My research interests include **phonological and morphosyntactic theory**, with a particular focus on the **interface between these modules**.

I have a diverse academic background, having initially studied Theoretical Physics and Mathematics in university before moving into Linguistics for my master's degree. While doing my master's, I became interested in the phenomenon of initial consonant mutation (ICM) in the Celtic languages.  I wrote my MPhil dissertation on this topic, looking at how interactions between grammatical modules could be modelled within the framework of Optimality Theory. I am currently working towards a PhD, continuing my research into the theory of Irish initial consonant mutation, but this time with a focus on analysing ICM within a strictly modular grammatical architecture.
