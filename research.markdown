## My research

I am currently working towards a PhD in the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of [Pavel Iosad](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/pavel-iosad){:target="_blank"} and [Peter Ackema](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/peter-ackema){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on how initial consonant mutation (ICM) in Irish and the other Celtic languages can be analysed within a strictly modular grammatical architecture.

ICM is the systematic phonological alternation of word-initial consonants in a range of morphosyntactically defined environments. Since it combines elements of phonology and morphosyntax in non-trivial ways, it is an ideal test bed for linguistic theory. In particular, an in-depth analysis of the system can inform our understanding of the interface between these two components of the grammar.

Working within a strictly modular framework, my PhD project aims to tease apart the roles played by each grammatical module in forming the highly complex ICM system that is found in Irish. Considerable promise has been shown by autosegmental models, in which ICM is caused by floating phonological material that latches onto the initial consonant of a word to produce the corresponding mutated form. I am currently exploring the ways in which this material interacts with the surrounding phonological environment and domain structure in Irish.
