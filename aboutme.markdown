## About me

My name is Anna Laoide-Kemp, and I am a PhD research student working in the field of Theoretical Linguistics. My research interests include **phonological and morphosyntactic theory**, with a particular focus on the **interface between these modules**.

I have a diverse academic background, having initially studied Theoretical Physics and Mathematics in university before moving into Linguistics for my master's degree. While doing my master's, I became interested in initial consonant mutation (ICM) in the Celtic languages.  I wrote my MPhil dissertation on this topic, looking at how interactions between grammatical modules could be modelled within the framework of Optimality Theory. I am currently working towards a PhD, continuing my research into the theory of Irish initial consonant mutation, but this time with a focus on analysing ICM within a strictly modular grammatical architecture.

You can read more about my research [here](./research.html), and see [here](./publications.html) for details of my presentations and publications to date.

Throughout my time in academia I have been actively involved in tutoring, and I consider it one of the most rewarding aspects of my career. I am passionate about creating a classroom environment where all students are supported to reach their full potential. I am also interested in innovative methods for introducing linguistic concepts, particularly the incorporation of language puzzles into the curriculum.

You can find out more about the courses I tutor on and my teaching philosophy [here](./teaching.html).
